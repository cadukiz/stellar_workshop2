# QuickAppsCMS Migration Project Context

## Project Overview
This project contains two parallel CakePHP applications for a migration from CakePHP 3 to CakePHP 5. The goal is to thoroughly document the existing QuickAppsCMS (CakePHP 3) application before migrating its functionality to a fresh CakePHP 5 installation.

## Project Structure

### 1. QuickAppsCMS (CakePHP 3) - Source Application
**Location**: `quickapps-cakephp3/`
**Purpose**: Existing application to be documented and migrated
**Status**: Fully functional installation

#### Docker Configuration:
- **Web Server**: http://localhost:8080
- **Database**: localhost:3306 (MySQL 5.7)
- **phpMyAdmin**: http://localhost:8091
- **PHP Version**: 7.4 with mcrypt extension
- **Container Names**: `quickapps-*` prefix
- **Network**: `quickapps-network`

#### Key Features:
- QuickAppsCMS installed and operational
- Custom Docker setup with mcrypt extension
- MySQL client available in web container
- Non-strict SQL mode configured
- Enhanced directory permissions

### 2. CakePHP 5 - Target Application
**Location**: `quickapps-cakephp5/`
**Purpose**: Fresh CakePHP 5 installation for migration target
**Status**: Clean installation ready for migration

#### Docker Configuration:
- **Web Server**: http://localhost:8090
- **Database**: localhost:3307 (MySQL 8.0)  
- **phpMyAdmin**: http://localhost:8091
- **PHP Version**: 8.2 (CakePHP 5 compatible)
- **Container Names**: `quickapps5-*` prefix
- **Network**: `quickapps5-network`

#### Key Features:
- Fresh CakePHP 5.2.7 installation
- Modern PHP 8.2 environment
- Separate Docker network to avoid conflicts
- Ready for clean migration implementation

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Documentation (Current)
- Comprehensive documentation of QuickAppsCMS architecture
- Database schema analysis and mapping
- Plugin and module inventory
- Custom functionality identification
- Configuration documentation

### Phase 2: Analysis
- Compare CakePHP 3 vs 5 differences
- Identify breaking changes and compatibility issues
- Plan migration approach for each component
- Create migration timeline and milestones

### Phase 3: Implementation
- Gradual migration of core functionality
- Update database schema for CakePHP 5
- Migrate plugins and custom modules
- Update templates and views
- Test and validate migrated features

## Technical Specifications

### Database Configuration
Both applications use separate MySQL instances:

**CakePHP 3 (Source)**:
- Host: `db` (within Docker)
- Database: `quickapps`
- User: `quickapps` / Password: `quickapps123`
- SQL Mode: `NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION` (non-strict)

**CakePHP 5 (Target)**:
- Host: `db` (within Docker)
- Database: `quickapps5`
- User: `quickapps5` / Password: `quickapps123`
- Modern MySQL 8.0 configuration

### Development Environment
- Both applications run simultaneously on different ports
- Docker Compose orchestration for each environment
- Isolated networks prevent conflicts
- Individual MySQL instances for data separation

## Current Status
- âœ… QuickAppsCMS installation completed successfully
- âœ… CakePHP 5 environment prepared and functional
- âœ… Both applications running simultaneously
- âœ… Docker configurations optimized
- ðŸ”„ Ready to begin comprehensive documentation phase

## Next Steps
1. Begin detailed documentation of QuickAppsCMS features
2. Map database schema and relationships
3. Identify custom plugins and modifications
4. Document configuration and environment setup
5. Create migration roadmap based on findings
